# SUPPORT YOUR ARTISTS

As of 2025, Spotify pays an average of $0.005 per stream to the artist. That means that if you give the equivalent of $5 directly to them (like merch, buying CDs, or just donating), you can """ethically""" listen to them a total of 1000 times. Of course, nobody thinks Spotify payment is fair, so preferably you should give more, but $5 is the bare minimum. Big names probably don't need those $5 dollars, but it might be _the_ difference between going out of business or not for that indie rock band you like.

# Spotizerr

A self-hosted music download manager with a lossless twist. Download everything from Spotify, and if it happens to also be on Deezer, download from there so you get those tasty FLACs.

## Why?

If you self-host a music server with other users than yourself, you almost certainly have realized that the process of adding requested items to the library is not without its friction. No matter how automated your flow is, unless your users are tech-savvy enough to do it themselves, chances are the process always needs some type of manual intervention from you, be it to rip the CDs yourself, tag some random files from youtube, etc. No more! Spotizerr allows for your users to access a nice little frontend where they can add whatever they want to the library without bothering you. What's that? You want some screenshots? Sure, why not:
